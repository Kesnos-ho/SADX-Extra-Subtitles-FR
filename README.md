## About

This mod displays subtitles for most voice lines with no text originally that you can encounter during normal play, except for voices stored in sound effect banks, like item get voices, Gamma's "mode change" and a lot of other things.

Subtitles will be displayed for the following:
* menu and character select voices (can be disabled in the config if you think they look bad)
* idle voices (common, adventure fields, action stages, bosses, mini games, Chao gardens)
* some character-specific gameplay voices (e.g. stage clear)
* adventure fields voices (train and Twinkle Park announcers)
* some cutscene voices (e.g. voices before and after Egg Walker boss battle)
* action stages voices (Sonic and Eggman in Tails' stages, Final Egg emergency alerts, Sky Chase voices)
* boss battle voices
* some unused voices triggered by [Fixes, Adds and Beta Restores](https://gamebanana.com/mods/49976) (e.g. Tikal's cheers at the beginning of Perfect Chaos boss battle)

Currently supported languages:
* English (2 sets: matching English dub and retranslated from Japanese by me)
* French (2 sets, translated by Kesnos)
* Japanese (experimental)
